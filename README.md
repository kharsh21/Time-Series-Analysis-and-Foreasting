# Time Series Analysis & Forecasting


## Objective
1. Utilizing historical Air Pollution dataset, impute missing values in it & forecast its future data trends.
  
2. Develop a ML model to accurately predict the closing price of a stock, enabling informed investment decisions.

## Approach
• Plotted the multi-variate time-series data and applied diverse techniques like interpolation, ffill/bfill, and ARMA/ARIMA for missing value imputation. Plot the the graph to show explicitly the filled missing values.

• Utilizing the LSTM model, a powerful recurrent neural network,trained it on a comprehensive historical stock’s dataset to analyze temporal dependencies& trends. Employed preprocessing techniques, such as normalization, scaling, and handling missing values, we optimized the model’s performance and improved prediction accuracy.

## Outcome
• Imputed missing values in the dataset & predicted its future values using forecasting techniques ARIMA/ARMA. 

• Achieve consistent single-digit Mean Square Error (MSE) in predicting the stock’s closing price & directional accuracy of 100%, which provide valuable insights to improve investment strategies & financial planning.
